# Tintash Training Document

I was hired at Tintash as an iOS Engineer through a comprehensive recruitment procedure and started my career at the company at their office in Lahore in the later half of June 2019. Being new to iOS development, the company put me through a rigorous training program to allow me to learn the core fundamentals of swift and gain hands on experience in various frameworks associated to it. The training program was planned to be six weeks long and was divided into three phases with each section attributing daily tasks to be completed through a stretch of two weeks. The well planned program and its immaculate execution since its inception greatly contributed to job satisfaction and the motivation to learn across multiple horizons of iOS application development.

# 1 - Swift Book (The Swift Programming Language)

The opening phase dealt with gaining the core knowledge of Apple’s programming language, Swift. We started learning about Swift 5 through gaining theoretical workings of the language and its capabilities by reading the official book, “The Swift Programming Language”. The book extensively covered multifarious aspects of the programming language ranging from basic operators and collections types which later lead to more complex topics including protocols, extensions, generics and memory safety. Additionally, the book presented ample theoretical explanations and code examples helped to further elaborate these concepts with clarity.

# 2 - iOS Development Tutorials

Upon completing the Swift book and gaining the core knowledge regarding the usage and capabilities of the language, we were tasked to complete multiple Development Tutorials in order to strengthen our practical forte on the development mechanics. Beginning from learning the basics of Xcode, these tutorials covered several vital concepts starting from the Application lifecycle and UI Components. Furthermore, we were also acclimated to the concepts of Protocol Oriented Programming and MVVM alongside those of Autolayout and Core Animation Layer - Crucial components of every iOS application. These tutorials were hand picked by our mentors, Sajjad Haider and Hira Alvi who were always available and very cooperative through their generous help whenever we reached a halt.

# 3 - Project

The Final phase of the Training program including a holistic project that covered all the concepts that we had learnt through our training program until that point. The project consisted of a Football application having multiple screens presenting a News Feed, Top Players and Teams, and a Gallery. In addition to this, a Cities screen was also added where external APIs were used to present information. The project was built according to the principles of Protocol Oriented Programming and MVVM and was regularly monitored by our mentors through daily meetings and feedback. Moreover, a comprehensive code review was arranged on the completion of the project pertaining to the company’s commitment of ensuring high quality code.
